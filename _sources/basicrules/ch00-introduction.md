*Project: Vanishing Isles* is a fantasy roleplaying game for co-operative play.
It is primarily about teamwork against conflict. Even a hero cannot fight an
army alone. Adventurers in the Vanishing Isles must work as a team to do
perform heroic feats and fend off great threats.

The Vanishing Isles is a place with great dangers. Demons hide within the upper
edges of society. Night beasts gather in the miasma, accosting sleeping
travelers and besieging towns. Forgotten beasts lie in wait in the far reaches
of the world, ready to awaken and topple cities. War between nations stains red
fields of battle. Whether the trouble is large or small, It is up to the heroes
of the Vanishing Isles to quell these threats and bring about a sense of peace.

## How to use these rules
For the most part, rules presented in this guide assume you already have a
basic understanding of tabletop roleplaying games, or have someone available
who can explain the basics. Some of these terms and basic concepts are
explained in the section on [Using the Dice](#using-the-dice) for the
uninitiated.

**Chapter 1** explains the core rules of play, including the general uses of
each of your stats and the different kinds of rolls you can make.

**Chapter 2** explains how to customize your character using the options found
in the [Player Options](/sources/characteroptions/) source.

<!-- **Chapter 3** explains the rules of combat. -->

## Components
{:id="components"}

To play *Project: Vanishing Isles*, the following components are necessary:

<ul>
	<li><strong>The <em>Project: Vanishing Isles</em> core rules</strong> -
	(This ruleset)</li>
	<li>
		<strong>A complete set of gaming dice</strong> - At least one of the
		following (preferably one set per participant).
		<ul>
			<li>A 4-sided die (d4)</li>
			<li>A 6-sided die (d6)</li>
			<li>An 8-sided die (d8)</li>
			<li>A 10-sided die (d10)</li>
			<li>A 12-sided die (d12)</li>
			<li>A 20-sided die (d20) (preferably 2 per person)</li>  
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>A set of "character sheets"</strong> - Pages listing rules and
	stats for each player's character</li>
</ul>

In addition, this game is built with tactical play in mind. While optional, the
following components can assist in such a playstyle.

- **A battlemap or grid sheet** - To represent the environments in which
battles take place.
- **Tokens for Characters** - Anything that can represent characters (heroes
	and villains). Figurines, icons, colored stones or discs. Even marks on paper
	will do in a pinch.  

## Your Role in Collaborative Fiction
{:id="your-role"}
*Project: Vanishing Isles* is best played with 1 participant acting as the
"Game Master" (GM) and another 3-5 players acting as "Players". The Game Master
and players work together to tell a story that is their campaign in the
Vanishing Isles.

### The Game Master's Role
{:id="gm-role"}
The Game Master dictates the world around the player characters, determining
what the heroes find, who they meet, and how the world and people respond to
the heroes' actions. The Game Master controls the non-player characters (NPC)
that the heroes meet, friendly or otherwise, and brings life to the world they
explore.  

The Game Master interprets the rules of the game and adjudicates situations
that are not fully covered by the ruleset. When a rules dispute comes up, the
Game Master should consider all sides of the discussion. In the end, everyone
should have a say in any changes to the rules, but the Game Master's word is
final.

The Game Master generates challenges for the heroes to overcome. The Game
Master serves not as an enemy to the players, but an advocate to their goals
and enjoyment. A moment of epic heroism is only as great as the struggle faced
in that moment.

### A Player's Role
{:id"players-role"}
A player creates a heroic character to adventure within the world of the
Vanishing Isles. They help build the world with respect to their player
character and their history. The player characters work together to achieve a
shared goal. A player has full agency over a character's choices and actions.
A player character can perform not only the actions outlined within the rules,
but also anything that would make sense for someone with their capabilities.

## Using the Dice
{:id="using-the-dice"}
### D20 Rolls
{:id="d20-rolls"}
Whenever you attempt an action that has a reasonable chance of failure, roll a
20-sided die (the d20). The result determines whether you succeed or fail.

 1. Roll the d20
 2. Add any relevant modifiers
 3. Compare the result to the target number (also known as the Difficulty
	  Class, or the DC)

The game master chooses the DC. If the result is greater than or equal to the
DC, you succeed. If the result is lower than the DC, you fail.

### Dice Advantage and Disadvantage
{:id="dice-advantage-disadvantage"}
When making a d20 roll, you may have to make a d20 roll “with dice advantage”
or “with dice disadvantage”. When rolling with dice advantage, roll 2d20 and
take only the highest die for the result. When rolling with dice disadvantage,
roll 2d20 and take only the lowest die for the result. This only applies to d20
rolls, as other dice do not benefit (or suffer) from dice advantage and
disadvantage.

*(For example, if you make a roll with dice disadvantage and roll a 15 and a 7,
the 7 when calculating the result. If you made that same roll with dice
advantage, you would instead take the 15. For another example, if you make a
roll like 1d20 + 1d4 with dice advantage, advantage would apply to the d20 roll
but not the 1d4 bonus.)*

When separate effects give both dice advantage and dice disadvantage on a roll,
they are canceled out, and the roll is made with neither (roll only 1d20). Dice
Advantage and disadvantage also do not “stack”, meaning if two effects give
dice advantage or dice disadvantage to a roll, you still only roll 2 d20 dice
and pick the highest or lowest.

When another effect lets you reroll a die and that die roll has been made with
dice advantage or dice disadvantage, you reroll only one die of your choice.

### Other Dice Rolls
{:id="other-rolls"}
Some rolls are called for that are not necessarily pass-or-fail. The die rolls
are written in a format like “3d6” or “2d4”. The number before the ‘d’
represents the number of dice rolled, whereas the number after the ‘d’
represents the size of the dice. When the rules or GM call for it, roll the
given number of dice with the given size and add them together. *(For example,
“2d8” means roll 2 8-sided dice.)*

Some rolls may be written with a number added to or subtracted from the roll,
like “3d4+4” or “1d8-1”. In these cases, simply roll the dice and add the
number to the roll. *(For example, “2d8+5” means roll 2d8 and add 5 to the
result.)*

### Multiplying, Dividing, and Rounding
{:id="dice-math"}
When a rule calls for a value to be divided, the result is rounded down,
meaning any remainder is dropped. For example, when 11 is halved, the result
is 5.

Remember to look for what exactly is being multiplied. For example, if an
effect states that “damage dice are doubled”, this does not include modifiers.
Unless otherwise stated, results are multiplied or divided after dice are
rolled.

### Modifiers
{:id="modifiers"}
A modifier is a value added to a stat or die roll. A positive modifier is
called a bonus, and a negative modifier is called a penalty.

Different modifiers that are applied to the same roll stack, but multiple
modifiers that come from the same source or that have the same type do not
unless stated otherwise. (For example, having a shield equipped grants a bonus
to your Guard stats, but having two shields does not grant the same bonus
twice.)

#### Modifier Types
{:id="modifier-types"}
Modifiers include but are not limited to:

Attribute Modifiers
: Derived from your Combat Attributes. Apply to Saving Throws, Guard stats,
	Attack and Damage rolls, Hit Point maximum, Initiative, and some other game
	elements.

Class Bonuses
: Derived from your class. Apply to Saving Throws, your Skill Point limit,
  Base Attack bonuses, hit dice, and some class-relevant features.

Boost Modifiers
: Gained from temporary effects, such as spells and magical items. Apply to
pretty much anything.
