*Project: Vanishing Isles* is a work-in-progress tabletop RPG for cooperative
group play in a fantasy world. The ruleset is heavily based on other d20-based
roleplaying games, but breaks some traditions in an attempt to improve the
game's play experience.

This game is one I'm building for mostly personal use, not with the intend of
being published and sold. It's not meant to be a wholly original work, nor is
it meant to be played by a mass audience. Instead, this game is created as a
vector for me to express my love for worldbuilding and D20 roleplaying.

## Where to start?

Before playing *Project: Vanishing Isles*, you should familiarize yourself with
the [basic rules](/sources/basicrules). When building a character, take a look
at the [character options](/sources/characteroptions).
